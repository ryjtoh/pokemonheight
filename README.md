What is the URL to your GitHub-Pages site?
What API did you use and why?

### API of Choice
I leveraged the PokeAPI in order to make GET requests to gather the locations within
Pokemon games where the searched Pokemon can be found. As a previous player of the games, finding where I can find each Pokemon in the game is easier with this solution
that can search across games. I am familiar with the data in the PokeAPI, which is why
I chose to use this API.

### Other Uses
The PokeAPI can also be used to gather stats of Pokemon that may not be referenced in the game, such as Natures and Growth Rates of Pokemon. The PokeAPI also includes a library of all the Pokemon, items, and moves that can be leveraged to create a real life "Pokedex," which acts as Pokemon dictionary in the games.

Explain the considerations you needed to make for the website to be responsive & mobile-friendly.
Because of the simplicity of the app, keeping all of the components of the centered sufficed in order to be mobile friendly.

How can you make your app accessible to people with disabilities such as blindness or colorblindness?
### Accessibility
Because of the color scheme of the app may be non-optimal for color blind users, I would add a color blind toggle for different types of colorblindness in order to account for these users. I also made the buttons and font relatively big in order to increase visibility for user with visual diablities. I could also implement a toggle feature to change the font to be more readable, as the chosen font was selected in order to match the video game theme.

If you could make further changes to your project to improve/expand the experience, what would they be and how would you go about implementing them
